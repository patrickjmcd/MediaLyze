## vUnreleased

### ✨ New

### 🐛 Bug fixes

## v0.1.2

>2026-03-13

### ✨ New

- Added a new `Feature flags` section under `App settings`.
- Added the `Show Dolby Vision Profiles` feature flag so Dolby Vision profile variants can be shown separately in Dynamic Range statistics and metadata views when explicitly enabled
- Added Dolby Vision profile extraction during `ffprobe` parsing for new scans, storing values like `Dolby Vision Profile 5/7/8` instead of only the generic Dolby Vision label
- Added a rescan tooltip for the Dolby Vision profile feature flag to clarify that installations used before `v0.1.1` may need a fresh scan

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Preserved quality-score dynamic range normalization so stored Dolby Vision profile variants still map to the existing Dolby Vision quality tier

## v0.1.1

>2026-03-13

### ✨ New

- Added official GitHub release support with tag-driven publishing and curated release notes
- Added a release metadata validation script to keep Docker, backend, and frontend versions aligned
- Added release PR validation in GitHub Actions so version and changelog mismatches fail before merge

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Switched official Docker publishing for `main` from branch-triggered builds to SemVer tag releases
- Updated the dev image workflow to derive its base version from Git tags instead of GHCR package APIs
- Normalized the repository version metadata to `0.1.1` ahead of the first official public release
